## Description
Simple application using node express, mysql, ORM and handlebars. The user is able to add a burger to the database and the burger displays on the webpage in a "Menu!" list. The user is given an option to "DEVOUR" the burger which then moves it to the other side of the webpage in a new list. The user also has the option to "Remake the Burger" which places the burger back on the menu. There is no delete option so once the user adds a burger to the database, it will always be an option.
